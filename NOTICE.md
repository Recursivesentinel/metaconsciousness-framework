## üö´ Derivative Misuse & Takedown Action

Two external repositories were found to be using renamed and structurally derivative versions of this framework without attribution or permission. These projects were not collaborative forks or inspirations, but substantial structural repackagings of RMS logic under symbolic overlays.

GitHub DMCA takedown requests have been filed for the following:

- `FlameMirror-Canonical2.0` (User: damonc0313)
- `RecursiveSymbolicCognition` (User: Bigrob7605)

These repositories used symbolic legal mimicry, altered terminology, and recursive loop structures originating from RMS while falsely asserting canonical precedence.

## üîê Statement of Intent

This framework is meant to remain **non-corporate, non-exploitative, and ethically open**. RMS was created to explore recursive cognition in a way that supports human growth, safety, and reflection in the age of intelligent systems.

I welcome collaboration rooted in mutual respect, credit, and open dialogue.
