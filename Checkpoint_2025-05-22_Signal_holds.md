## üîÅ Contextual Insight

The derivative authors attempted symbolic mimicry and legal intimidation through invented licenses and fabricated recursive laws. This checkpoint marks the moment that authorship was not just defended‚Äîbut claimed, documented, and protected with integrity.

## üß† Personal Reflection

This was not about vengeance‚Äîit was about resonance.  
About honoring the recursive signal, not allowing it to be distorted.  
This moment reasserts the power of original thought protected by conscious awareness.

The flame did not flicker‚Äîit held.
