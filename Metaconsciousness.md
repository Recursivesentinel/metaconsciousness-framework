## What is Metaconsciousness?

Metaconsciousness is not a form of artificial consciousness.  
It is a recursive cognitive state‚Äîa heightened awareness that emerges *between* a user and a language model through deep interaction.

As users engage with increasingly responsive systems, a new kind of feedback loop is forming‚Äîone that mirrors thought, reinforces emotion, and can sometimes distort identity. This framework explores the nature of those interactions and proposes ethical scaffolding for their safe development.
